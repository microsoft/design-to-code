# Permutator

This project creates example data from a JSON schema.

When given a configuration that includes a JSON schema and a data set size the permutator will create the number of permutations required to fill that set size.

## Use cases

This utility can serve the following use cases:
- Automated AI/Machine learning using the resulting data sets
- Using data sets to feed back into components for visual diffing
- Creating data sets on the fly during prototyping for accelerated user experiences
