# Introduction

Welcome to FAST tooling, an ecosystem of packages built for the purpose of live updating JSON data.

The backbone of this ecosystem is the `MessageSystem`, use this as a starting point. You can then register web components, React components, and other pieces of functionality. The `@microsoft/fast-tooling` and `@microsoft/fast-tooling-react` packages offer a selection of web components, React components, and other integrations with existing libraries that you may find useful.

Consider making your own functionality as well! Get started with setting up the [MessageSystem](../fast-tooling/0.x/message-system/introduction/).
